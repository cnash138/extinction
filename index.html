  		<p>Wooly Mamonths, otherwise known as Mammuthus primigenius, are extinct relatives of today's elelphant. Alive during the Ice Age they Wooly Mammonth was one of the first to become extinct towards the end with the rapid temprature rise. Believe it or not, the temprature changes, aren't the only reasoning behind this historic creatures demise. The combination of excessive human huntingfact , temprature, and food/water supply is are the primary reasonings. In fact, scientists have recently discovered that lack of water is what killed the last of the species off. Traveling in herds probably did not help their fall, becuase animals that live and travel in herds tend to die off in herds. </p>

	    	<p>The word "mammonth" has come to mean "huge". It might come as a suprise to find out that the Wolly Mammonth is only about guessed to be the size of an African elelphant.  The mamonths tusks on the other hand were massive, with the average size at 15ft. They used their monsterious tusks for fighting and digging up snow. Don't be fooled, these herbivores who's diets consists of grass and plants, aren't involved with fights unless provoked.  Mammonths seem to not have the most perportional bodies, with ears way smaller, and closer to the top of their head than those of todays elephants. This is guessed to be an adaptation due to the Arctic tempratues of the Ice Age. </p>
